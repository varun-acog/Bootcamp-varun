Adding gutters between sections helps maintain visual clarity and ensures a clean, organized layout. Gutters are essentially the space between elements, and they can be implemented in several ways, depending on your layout strategy. Below are some common methods to add gutters:

1. Using Margins (Simple Approach)
Add margins between sections to create space.

html
Copy code
<section style="margin-bottom: 20px; background-color: lightgray; padding: 20px;">
    Section 1
</section>
<section style="margin-bottom: 20px; background-color: lightblue; padding: 20px;">
    Section 2
</section>
<section style="background-color: lightgreen; padding: 20px;">
    Section 3
</section>
Pros: Easy to implement and understand.
Cons: Margins can be inconsistent across responsive designs without careful handling.
2. Using CSS Gap (Modern Approach)
If you use CSS Grid or Flexbox, you can leverage the gap property to define uniform spacing between sections.

For Flexbox
html
Copy code
<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; gap: 20px;">
    <section style="background-color: lightgray; padding: 20px;">Section 1</section>
    <section style="background-color: lightblue; padding: 20px;">Section 2</section>
    <section style="background-color: lightgreen; padding: 20px;">Section 3</section>
</div>
