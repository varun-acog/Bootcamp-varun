      <h3>1. Problems Identified</h3>
      <p>Below are the problems annotated using the Awesome Screenshot tool:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Lack of Visual Hierarchy:</strong> The text-heavy layout makes
          it hard to identify important news items. Font size and weight are
          similar across the page, reducing clarity.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Poor Navigation:</strong> The news list lacks categorization
          and filtering options, making it overwhelming for users to find
          relevant updates.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Outdated Design:</strong> The website uses an older HTML
          design with minimal spacing, cluttered content, and lacks modern
          styling.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No Responsiveness:</strong> The page does not render well on
          mobile devices, which impacts usability on smaller screens.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No Hover effects:</strong> There are no hover effects for
          buttons which makes them difficult to find whether they are clickable
          or not.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Overloaded Links:</strong> Too many links placed close
          together make navigation confusing and reduce readability.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Websites That Do It Better</h3>
      <p>
        Here are examples of websites with similar functionalities done better,
        along with reasons:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>1. BBC News</strong> -
          <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news" target="_blank">Visit BBC News</a>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Why:</strong> BBC News excels in visual hierarchy, clean
              navigation, and mobile responsiveness. Headlines are prominent,
              sections are categorized logically, and images are used to break
              text monotony.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Key Inspiration:</strong> Use of large headlines, content
              sections with clear filters, and ample white space for better
              readability.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2. The New York Times</strong> -
          <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/" target="_blank"
            >Visit The New York Times</a
          >
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Why:</strong> Modern typography, intuitive layout, and
              multimedia elements (videos/images) keep users engaged. The page
              has visual flow, making it easy to scan content.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Key Inspiration:</strong> Implement responsive design and
              clean visual separation between news items.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>3. Government of Canada News</strong> -
          <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/news.html" target="_blank"
            >Visit Canada News</a
          >
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Why:</strong> Itâ€™s a government site with clear
              categorization of topics, filters for easy navigation, and a focus
              on accessibility for all users.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Key Inspiration:</strong> Add search filters,
              well-organized news categories, and improve contrast for
              accessibility.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

      <h3>3. Suggested Improvements</h3>
      <p>
        Based on the issues identified and inspirations, here are my
        recommendations to improve the website:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Improve Visual Hierarchy:</strong> Use larger, bold fonts for
          headings, increase spacing, and highlight key news items.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Add Filtering Options:</strong> Allow users to sort news by
          date, category, or relevance.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Modernize Design:</strong> Use a responsive layout with CSS
          Grid or Flexbox to organize content. Add visuals like thumbnails or
          icons to break up text.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Enhance Mobile Responsiveness:</strong> Ensure the site scales
          well across devices by implementing a responsive design.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Reduce Link Overload:</strong> Group related links into
          dropdowns or sections to reduce clutter.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Add Hover effects:</strong> Should add hover effects for
          buttons which makes them easy find whether they are clickable or not.
        </li>
      </ul>
