    <h1>Annotations and Suggestions for IRCTC Train Search Page</h1>

    <h2>Issues Identified</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Cluttered Interface:</strong> The page has an overwhelming
        amount of information displayed without clear grouping or
        prioritization.
        <ul>
          <li>
            Example: The multiple fields for input like "From," "To," and
            "Journey Date" are not well-spaced, causing confusion for new users.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Design Consistency:</strong> The color scheme and fonts lack
        modern aesthetics, making the interface appear outdated.
        <ul>
          <li>
            Example: The mix of different shades of blue and white does not
            follow a cohesive design principle.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Navigation Issues:</strong> Key actions, such as logging in and
        accessing frequently used features, are not prominently visible or
        user-friendly.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Lack of Responsiveness:</strong> The layout does not adapt
        seamlessly to smaller screens, making it difficult to use on mobile
        devices.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Pop-ups and Redirects:</strong> Frequent pop-ups for promotional
        content interrupt the user experience.
      </li>
    </ol>
