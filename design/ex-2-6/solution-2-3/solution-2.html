        <h2>9th India-Thailand Defence Dialogue</h2>
        <p>
          The 9th India-Thailand Defence Dialogue took place in New Delhi on
          December 12, 2024. The meeting was co-chaired by Joint Secretary
          (International Cooperation) Shri Amitabh Prasad and Thailand’s Deputy
          Permanent Secretary for Defence Gen Tharapong Malakam.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both sides agreed for early establishment of Joint Working Group to
          effectively steer and monitor the cooperation in the areas of defence
          industry. Both sides also agreed to conduct Subject Matter Experts
          Exchange between Indian and the Thai Armed Forces to carry forward and
          institutionalise regular engagement in niche domains.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Indian co-chair highlighted the potential of domestic defence
          industry with capacity and capability to cooperate with the Royal Thai
          Armed Forces in its defence acquisition plans. Thailand appreciated
          the capability of Indian defence industry ecosystem and proposed
          exploring possibilities for co-design, co-production and
          co-development in the field of defence industry.
        </p>
        <p>
          The dialogue is a significant milestone in intensifying defence
          relations with Thailand. Thailand is a maritime neighbour and a valued
          partner in India’s ‘Act East’ Policy and the Indo-Pacific region.
          Thailand’s ‘Act West’ Policy compliments India’s ‘Act East’ Policy
          providing basis for substantive elevation of bilateral relations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Earlier in the day, the Deputy Permanent Secretary laid a wreath and
          paid homage to the fallen heroes at National War Memorial, New Delhi.
          The Thailand delegation also visited National Museum and paid respects
          to the Holy relics of Lord Buddha placed at Museum.
        </p>
        <p>
          As part of the visit, the Thailand delegation will visit DRDO
          headquarters and discuss ways to enhance defence industrial
          capabilities by cooperation in defence research and joint production.
        </p>
