# ASSIGNMENT-2: Annotation System Project
## Problem Definition
Modern data visualization and annotation systems require flexibility and user interactivity. Current solutions often lack composability, extensibility, and integration of annotations. We aim to build a prototype that allows authenticated users to view data (graphs, tables, or text), interact with components described in JSON, and add annotations for collaboration and insights.

## Users
* Data Analysts: Explore and annotate visualized data for reporting or presentations.
* Researchers: Comment on specific data points or observations in graphs or tables.
* Developers: Extend and customize the generic system for different use cases.
* Users interact with:
JSON-driven components for data visualization.
Annotation tools for adding, editing, and deleting notes.
Authentication to ensure secure and personalized access.

## Plan
Breakdown of the Problem
* Authentication:
Implement OTP and credential-based login using auth.js for secure access.
Ensure session handling and user role management.
* Component System:
Design JSON schema to define widgets (e.g., graphs, tables, text).
Build a generic rendering engine to parse JSON and render components.
Allow composite components to support nested widgets.
* Data Rendering:
Load CSV data dynamically to populate tables, graphs, and cards.
Support multiple visualization types (e.g., bar charts, pie charts).
* Annotations:
Provide a user-friendly UI for adding, editing, and deleting annotations.
Link annotations to specific data points or regions in graphs/tables.
Store annotations persistently (e.g., in a database).

## Step-by-Step Development Plan
* Version 0: Proof of Concept
Authentication:
Implement basic OTP and credential-based login using auth.js to secure user access.
Component System:
Design and implement a JSON schema to define components like tables and graphs.
Build a rendering engine that reads the schema and dynamically generates UI components.
Data Integration:
Develop a CSV parser to read and populate data into components (tables, graphs, etc.).

* Version 1: Core Features
Annotations:
Introduce an interactive annotation system with support for adding, editing, and deleting notes.
Link annotations to specific data points or UI elements.
Component Enhancements:
Extend the JSON-driven design to support nested and composite components.
Enable flexible configurations for complex UI layouts.

* Version 2: Advanced Features
Annotation Storage:
Implement APIs for storing and retrieving annotations persistently in a database.
Ensure annotations are linked to users and sessions for personalized insights.
Expanded Visualization Support:
Add support for advanced visualization types like heatmaps, line charts, and scatter plots.
Optimize rendering for real-time updates on visualizations.



* Version 3: Final Version
Performance Optimization:
Ensure efficient rendering and interaction, even with large datasets and complex visualizations.
Minimize load times for data parsing and component generation.
Accessibility and Compatibility:
Ensure compliance with accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG).
Test and optimize the system for cross-browser and multi-device compatibility.
Documentation and Deployment:
Create detailed user guides, developer documentation, and setup instructions.
Prepare deployment scripts and configurations for seamless installation.


## Exit Criteria
The project is complete when:
All core and advanced features are implemented and tested.
The system can dynamically render JSON-defined components with populated data.
Annotation features are robust and user-friendly.
Comprehensive documentation and deployment guides are available.

## Project Deliverables
* Source Code: Complete codebase for the system, hosted in a version-controlled repository (e.g., GitHub).
* Executable Prototype: Deployable version with an interactive UI.
* Documentation:
User guides for accessing, navigating, and annotating the system.
Developer guides for extending the component system.
Deployment and setup instructions.
