      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          This document outlines a solution for creating an e-commerce site like
          Amazon or Flipkart without relying on a traditional server-side
          application. The site will be static, using only HTML, CSS,
          JavaScript, and JSON data. The primary objective is to deliver a
          performant, scalable, and low-cost website hosted on platforms like
          Netlify or Cloudflare.
        </p>
        <p>
          By generating the site statically and leveraging client-side
          JavaScript, we can provide the necessary dynamic features such as
          search and navigation without relying on server-side infrastructure.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Static Site Generation Approach</h2>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          To generate the static site, we will create HTML files and embed
          product data in JSON format. These files will be pre-generated and
          hosted on a static file hosting platform. The static content will be
          generated through a build process that compiles and optimizes the
          files.
        </p>
        <p>Key steps include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Fetching product data from a database or external API and converting
            it into JSON format.
          </li>
          <li>
            Generating HTML pages from the JSON data, which will include product
            listings, search results, and other content.
          </li>
          <li>
            Optimizing the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for fast performance and
            lower load times.
          </li>
          <li>
            Hosting the generated files on a platform such as Netlify,
            Cloudflare, or GitHub Pages.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Client-Side Features</h2>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          Even though the site is static, we can add several dynamic features
          using JavaScript. For example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Search:</strong> JavaScript will allow users to search the
            product catalog by keywords, and it will filter results in real
            time. The search can support features like typos, word stems, and
            proximity searches.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Filtering:</strong> Clients can apply filters (e.g., price,
            brand, rating) to narrow down product selections.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Pagination:</strong> For a large product catalog, JavaScript
            can paginate the results to reduce the number of items loaded at
            once.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Limitations and Considerations</h2>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          Although static sites offer many advantages, there are certain
          limitations to be aware of:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Catalog Size:</strong> As the number of products increases,
            loading all items at once might impact performance. Pagination and
            client-side filtering are essential to handle large datasets
            efficiently.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>SEO:</strong> Static sites provide good SEO out of the box
            since all content is available to search engines immediately.
            However, dynamic JavaScript content may require additional
            considerations to ensure it is indexed properly.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Updates:</strong> If the product catalog or other content
            changes frequently, a build process is required to regenerate the
            static site and re-upload the new files.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          Static site generation is a powerful approach for building a fast and
          scalable e-commerce website without the need for traditional
          server-side infrastructure. With the right client-side JavaScript
          enhancements like search and filtering, we can deliver a dynamic user
          experience even with a static site.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hosting this type of site on platforms like Netlify or Cloudflare
          provides both cost-efficiency and excellent performance.
        </p>
        <p>
          For large-scale e-commerce applications, static generation works well
          for certain types of content but may need to be complemented with
          dynamic elements where necessary.
